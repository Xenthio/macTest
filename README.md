# sm64pc
OpenGL adaptation of [n64decomp/sm64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64). 

Feel free to report bugs and contribute, but remember, there must be **no upload of any copyrighted asset**. 
Run `./extract-assets.py --clean && make clean` or `make distclean` to remove ROM-originated content. This port has been made possible thanks to [n64-fast32-engine](https://github.com/Emill/n64-fast3d-engine/) by [Emill](https://github.com/Emill).

## Features

 * Native rendering. You can now play SM64 without the need of an emulator. 
 * Variable aspect ratio and resolution. The game can now correctly render at basically any window size.
 * Native xinput controller support. On Linux, DualShock 4 has been confirmed to work plug-and-play.
 * Analog camera control and mouse look. (Activate with `make BETTERCAMERA=1`.)
 * An option to disable drawing distances. (Activate with `make NODRAWINGDISTANCE=1`.)
 * In-game control binding, currently available on the `testing` branch.
 * Skip introductory Peach & Lakitu cutscenes with a `--skip-intro` CLI option, currently available on `testing` and `skip-intro` branches.
